Algorithm Questions
      You can use any language or pseudocode to solve these problems.
1. We know that the form of a quadratic equation is ax^2 + bx + c = 0 .Write a program that, by receiving the coefficients (a, b, c), calculates the solutions of the equation.

2. Define a class Animal with a method speak that prints "Animal sound".Create a subclass Dog that overrides the speak method to print "Woof!".Instantiate an object of Dog and call the speak method.

3. Given a string, ASCII characters along with any character, How would you reverse a string without affecting punctuation characters? 
  Input:   str = "ahmad,bahram$cookie"      Output:  str = "eikoo,cmarha$bdamha"

4.Given an (m *  n) integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
 Input:   [[1,2,3],         Output:  [[1,0,3],
              [4,0,6],                        [0,0,0],
              [7,8,9]]                        [7,0,9]]
     DB Questions
5. We have two tables :
        parents ( id:int , name:string , has_children:boolean default false)
        children (id:int , name:string , parent_id: foreign key to parents)
 Write a SQL query to update the “has_children” field in the parents table to “false” if a parent has no child.
6.Describe the benefits of denormalization on a high traffic web application. Feel free to use examples.
